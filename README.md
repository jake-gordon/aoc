# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.
Questions and comments are more than welcome.

## 2022

I plan to complete the puzzles in `C#` this year as an opportunity to learn more about `.NET` and language features such as `LINQ`, but also to explore object-oriented programming.
